        Welcome reader, to my portfolio! <br />
        Here you can find a lovely page where I talk about myself, see the
        journey I've been on, and find out how I went from knowing nothing, to
        being a full stack developer in just 4 months. You can also have a look
        at the finest selection of projects that I've been a part of, from a
        Twitter bot to a full-stack community app! And there's also a contact
        tab, for if you ever want to contact me!
      </p>
